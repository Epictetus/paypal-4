== Welcome to the PayPal Rails Kit

This Kit will help you get a quick start on building new web
applications with PayPal API integration.  Please see the included
PDF for more information about using this code.

== Getting Started

This code provides a complete, running Rails application. To get
started, make sure you have ruby and rubygems installed, then
install the necessary gems with bundler via the following
commands:

gem install bundler

bundler install

Then create and migrate your databases by running the following
rake command on the command line:

rake bootstrap

Once that's done, you are ready to run the application on
localhost. Start up the app by running ./script/rails server and
browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000.
